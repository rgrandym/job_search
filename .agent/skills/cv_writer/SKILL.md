name: cv_writer
description: Create or update the structured Master CV, tailor it to a job description with ATS keywords and STAR-format bullets (no fabricated facts), and export it to a styled Word (.docx) document. Use when the user wants to import/edit their CV, tailor a CV to a job, or produce a .docx CV.

# cv_writer

Turns a factual **Master CV** into job-specific, ATS-optimised CVs and exports them to `.docx`.

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `master_cv_schema.json` | JSON Schema of the Master CV. **Generated** from `src/cv/models.py::MasterCV`. Never hand-edit. |
| `docx_templates.py` | CLI to render a CV JSON to `.docx` with a named template. |
| `src/cv/master_cv_manager.py` | load / save / validate / import / merge-patch the Master CV |
| `src/cv/tailor.py` | JD analysis → tailoring plan (LLM) → guarded application (deterministic) |
| `src/cv/docx_exporter.py` | Word rendering + template definitions (`TEMPLATES`) |

The Master CV lives at `data/master_cv.json` (git-ignored, personal data). Example:
`data/examples/master_cv.example.json`.

## 1. Create or update the Master CV

The web UI first stores uploaded files unchanged in `data/cvs/`. Uploading and selecting a CV
must not parse it or call an LLM. Conversion to the structured Master CV happens on demand when
the user requests a CV-powered action such as profile matching, summarisation, or tailoring.

**From raw text / Markdown:**
```bash
python -m src.cv.master_cv_manager import path/to/cv.md --out data/master_cv.json
python -m src.cv.master_cv_manager validate data/master_cv.json
```
After import, **show the user what was extracted and ask them to confirm** dates, titles and
metrics. The LLM transcribes. It must not embellish.

**Editing by hand or by agent:** edit the JSON, then re-run `validate`. In code, use
`master_cv_manager.update(cv, patch)` (RFC 7386 merge patch: `null` deletes a key, lists are
replaced whole) followed by `save()`, which keeps a `.bak`.

**Schema rules that matter:**
- `start` / `end` are `YYYY-MM`. `end: null` means current role.
- Every experience, project and bullet has a unique lowercase `id`. Tailoring uses bullet
  ids for provenance, so **never renumber existing ids**. Append new ones.
- `bullets[].metrics` holds the verbatim numbers in that bullet. `bullets[].skills` holds only
  the skills that bullet evidences. These two lists are what the anti-fabrication guard trusts.
- `preferences` (target titles, locations, work arrangements, relocation) feeds job search
  and is never printed on the CV.

If you change `MasterCV`, regenerate the schema: `python -m src.cv.master_cv_manager export-schema`.

---

## 2. Analyse the job description

`tailor.analyze_jd(jd_text, llm) -> JDAnalysis`

1. **Identify the role**: `job_title`, `company`, `seniority`
   (intern · junior · mid · senior · staff · principal · manager · director · executive).
2. **Hard keywords** (`hard_skills`): concrete, ATS-matchable nouns: languages, frameworks,
   platforms, methods, domains, certifications. Use canonical names ("Kubernetes", not "k8s").
3. **Soft keywords** (`soft_skills`): stakeholder management, mentoring, ownership, …
4. **Priority split**: `must_have` (required / "you have") vs `nice_to_have`
   (preferred / bonus). Use the JD's own words. Do not infer requirements it doesn't state.
5. **Responsibilities**: the verbs and outcomes the role is accountable for. These shape
   which bullets get promoted.

---

## 3. Rewrite bullets as STAR accomplishments, without hallucinating

`tailor.propose_plan(...) -> TailoringPlan`, then `tailor.apply_plan(...)` enforces the rules.

For each relevant Master CV bullet, produce one `RewrittenBullet` with `source_id` = that
bullet's id. Compress STAR into one sentence:

> **Action verb** + *Situation/Task context* + **what you did (using JD terminology)** + *measurable Result*

| Source bullet | Tailored (JD asks for "MLOps", "cost optimisation") |
| --- | --- |
| Led migration of model training pipelines to Kubernetes, cutting training costs by 35%. | Drove MLOps migration of model training pipelines to Kubernetes, cutting training costs 35%. |

**Allowed:** rephrasing, reordering clauses, swapping in the JD's synonym for the *same* thing,
dropping irrelevant detail, promoting relevant bullets, omitting irrelevant ones (keep ≥ 2/role).

**Forbidden, and auto-rejected by `apply_plan`:**
- Any number, %, currency amount or count not present in the source bullet or its `metrics`.
- Any JD hard skill / must-have not evidenced by the source bullet **and** absent from the
  Master CV's skills.
- Unknown `source_id`s, or merging facts from two bullets into one.
- Inventing employers, titles, dates, team sizes, or scope ("global", "company-wide") the source lacks.

Rejected rewrites keep the original bullet. Every decision is logged in `TailoredCV.changes`
(`accepted`, `reason`). **Report rejected rewrites and `missing_keywords` to the user.** A
missing keyword is a gap to discuss, never something to paper over. If the user confirms they
do have that experience, add it to the **Master CV** first, then re-tailor.

Also produced: `headline` (target role), `summary` (2–3 sentences, numbers must exist in the
CV), `bullet_order`, `skills_priority` (re-orders existing skills only).

Run end to end in code:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from src.core.llm_provider import get_llm_provider
from src.cv import master_cv_manager as mgr, tailor

tailored = tailor.tailor(mgr.load(Path("data/master_cv.json")), jd_text, get_llm_provider())
Path("output/tailored_acme.json").write_text(tailor.dump_tailored(tailored))
```
`tailored.keyword_coverage` is the ATS hit-rate (0–1) over JD hard skills + must-haves.

---

## 4. Export to Word

```bash
python .agent/skills/cv_writer/docx_templates.py --list
python .agent/skills/cv_writer/docx_templates.py \
    --cv output/tailored_acme.json --template classic --out output/Alex_Example_Acme.docx
```
Accepts either a `MasterCV` or a `TailoredCV` JSON. In code: `docx_exporter.export_docx(cv, path, template)`.

Templates (`classic`, `modern`, `compact`) are `DocxTemplate` objects in
`src/cv/docx_exporter.py`: font, sizes, accent colour, margins, section order. To add one,
add an entry to `TEMPLATES` there. Low-level python-docx helpers are in `src/tools/docx_tools.py`.

**ATS constraints (all templates must keep them):** single column; no tables, text boxes,
images or content in headers/footers; native Word bullet lists ("List Bullet" style);
standard section names (Summary, Experience, Skills, Education, Certifications); dates as
`Mon YYYY – Mon YYYY`.

Name output files `<First>_<Last>_<Company>.docx` under `output/` (git-ignored).
